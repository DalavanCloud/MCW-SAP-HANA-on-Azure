# SAP HANA on Azure hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will step through the implementation of a highly available SAP HANA deployment on Microsoft Azure virtual machines running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 

After its completion, you will be able to provision Azure infrastructure components necessary to support highly available SAP HANA deployments, configure Azure virtual machines to support highly available SAP HANA installations, implement SUSE Linux Enterprise clustering, install SAP HANA, configure SAP HANA system replication, and test failover scenarios.

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you are working with Contoso to develop a process of implementing a highly available deployment of SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines (VMs). Your tasks will include provisioning of Azure infrastructure components of the deployment, setting up a clustered pair of Azure Linux VMs running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to support SAP HANA, installing SAP HANA instance on each of the Azure VMs, and configuring SAP HANA system replication between them.

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription

-   A lab computer running Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with:

    -   access to Microsoft Azure

    -   access to the SAP HANA installation media (requires an SAP Online Service System account)

    -   an SSH client e.g. PuTTY, available from <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>

    -   WinSCP client available from <https://winscp.net/eng/download.php>

-   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 60-day free trial subscription (available from <https://www.suse.com/products/server/download/> ) via which you obtain registration code for an evaluation copy of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP3 for x86-64

## Exercise 1: Provision Azure infrastructure

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure prerequisites for implementing SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines (VMs). This will include creating such resources as an Azure virtual network, Azure VMs in the same availability set, an Azure load balancer, and Azure Storage accounts as well as assigning static IPs to each VM.
