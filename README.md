# SAP HANA on Azure

Contoso, a pharmaceutical company, wants to migrate its SAP HANA deployment to Azure. In order to evaluate Azure Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) capabilities, Contoso needs to set up a highly available deployment of SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines, running SUSE Linux Enterprise Edition. 

## Target audience

- SAP Basis Professionals

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to provision a highly available deployment of SAP HANA in Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session and the hands-on lab, you will look at the planning process for SAP HANA migration and deployment. You will identify and implement Azure infrastructure components necessary to support a clustered deployment of SAP HANA. You will also step through installing SAP HANA and configuring SAP HANA system replication. Finally, you will review and test different scenarios that involve manual and automatic failover between cluster nodes.

At the end of this workshop you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure. After its completion, you will be able to provision Azure infrastructure components necessary to support highly available SAP HANA deployments, configure Azure virtual machines to support highly available SAP HANA installations, implement SUSE Linux Enterprise clustering, install SAP HANA, configure SAP HANA system replication, and test high availability scenarios.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this Whiteboard Design Session, you will look at what is involved in deploying SAP HANA on Azure with the goals of designing for high availability, disaster recovery as well as supportability.

At the end of this whiteboard design session you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will step through the implementation of a highly available SAP HANA deployment on Microsoft Azure virtual machines running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 

After its completion, you will be able to provision Azure infrastructure components necessary to support highly available SAP HANA deployments, configure Azure virtual machines to support highly available SAP HANA installations, implement SUSE Linux Enterprise clustering, install SAP HANA, configure SAP HANA system replication, and test failover scenarios.
