# SAP HANA on Azure whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this Whiteboard Design Session, you will look at what is involved in deploying SAP HANA on Azure with the goals of designing for high availability, disaster recovery as well as supportability.

At the end of this whiteboard design session you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study

### Customer situation

Contoso Group is a global pharmaceutical company with its headquarters based in Boston, US.

Contoso has been using SAP ERP and BW on HANA for its Finance/Logistics/Analytics systems on the HP-UX/Oracle platform.

Contoso Leadership and Planning Groups wants to drastically reduce server and storage hardware in their own datacenters to minimize IT related costs. Contoso has already a number of their non-SAP systems migrated to Azure. The leadership asked Contoso IT to look into the possibility of migrating its SAP HANA environment to cloud.

Contoso IT decided to leverage its knowledge of the Microsoft cloud platform and existing ExpressRoute connectivity and host its SAP landscape in Azure. The intention is to migrate the BW system first (go live in March CY19), and migrate ECC in Q4 of CY19. The multi-stage approach is supposed to minimize potential migration risks.

Considering that Contoso management team often uses BW to support their management decisions, the systems should be highly available, and their performance must be predictable and consistent. In addition, the management team wants to leverage disaster recovery capabilities offered by Azure in order to ensure resiliency of the migrated environment in case the primary region hosting the new deployment becomes unavailable.

As Andrew Cross, CIO of Contoso Group emphasized this point by stating "Our operational dependencies on SAP applications force us to seek reasonably priced availability and disaster recovery capabilities for our production SAP HANA deployments."

Before migrating the production environment, Contoso wants to test its new deployment approach by provisioning training, development, test, and UAT environments in Azure.

### Customer needs 

-   Highly responsive systems with low network latency
-   In-memory database performance
-   High availability & disaster recovery
-   Enterprise data protection & security
-   Safe migration with downtime minimized
-   Access from HANA-based applications
-   Minimized cost
1.  Design scope:

    -   BW migration to HANA in Azure VMs

        -   Go-live date: March 2019

        -   Current BW (ABAP Unicode) on-premises with HP-UX/Oracle and application layer on Linux

        -   Customer requests flexible VM solution within Cloud to accommodate the BW workloads

            -   Use 1-year Reserved VM Instance option for Production VMs

    -   ERP is kept on-premises (with HP-UX/Oracle) until December 2019

        -   Data is transferred from ERP (on-premises) to BW (in Cloud) every hour

    -   (Option) Need to start to prepare for ERP migration to Cloud

2.  Target environment:

    -   Sizing

        -   Production (3-tier) with latest OS/DB fully certified and supported by SAP

            -   HANA sizing memory requirement 1.2 TB, estimate 1.9 TB in 3 years

            -   Throughput DB files at least 400MB/s \[/hana/data\]

            -   Throughput DB Log files at least 250MB/s \[/hana/log\]

            -   BW application servers: 15K SAPS

        -   Certification is NOT required for non-Prod

            -   QA (2-tier) HANA database server: 800 GB

            -   Dev, Test (both 2-tier) HANA database server(s): 256 GB

    -   Uptime -- Prod: 24x7, 744 hours/month, QA - 50 hours/month, DEV/Test - 200 hours/month

3.  High availability and disaster recovery

    -   Availability

        -   Both HA and Non-HA options need to be proposed

        -   With HA option, in case of server/storage issues, auto failover to complete within a few minutes, in case of a disaster recovery within 1 day

    -   Backup

        -   Long term backup -- use reasonable backup storage in Cloud

        -   Data loss not allowed

        -   HANA DB log backup taken every 30 minutes

        -   DB log backup to be kept for 1 day (DB restore to be fast)

        -   HANA DB full backup every night

        -   Daily HANA DB full backup to be retained for 1 month

        -   Monthly HANA DB full backup for 1 year, annual for 3 years

4.  End user access

    -   User locations -- 300 from US, 50 LATAM, 50 Europe, 30 Asia - all intranet

    -   Currently ExpressRoute is set up to Azure East US 2

    -   Response time needs to be minimized

### Customer objections 

1.  ECC remains on-premises until Dec CY19. How can we maintain integrations between ECC and BW?

2.  How much does Azure cost? Give us a few options (e.g. HA and non-HA, DR and non-DR).

3.  Do I have to pay for virtual machines when they are stopped?

4.  Can I automate the shutdown of virtual machines at periodic times of day?
